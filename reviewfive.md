## Game Title: Gauntlet Dark Legacy

### Rating
From a rate of 1 to 5 stars, I give Gauntlet a 2.5 out of 5 single player, 3 out of 5 stars with multiplayer.

### Summary
The plot begins in the ancient times, where the evil mage Garm, using the power of the Runestones, released evil upon the world. The demon, Skorne, then broke free of Garm's control. Skorne released his dark minions on the world, and scattered the Runestones across Eight Realms different realms, so that they won't be able to be assembled and used against him. So you, the player, must stop the evil Skorne from destorying the world and rid it of this evil by obtaining the runestones and defeating Skorne.

Gauntlet Dark Legacy plays similar to its predecessors but with new levels, items, characters, and combat capabilities. The player has an option of performing a different type of attack. From slow, but strong to quick, but weaker. The player can perform combos by using slow attacks and quick attacks in a melee style of combat. Combos are much stronger than normal attacks, and are usually capable of taking out several enemies at once. Each player has a turbo gauge that refills itself slowly and automatically. This turbo gauge allows the player to use turbo attacks, which does damage to a large area all at once and goes through multiple enemies and walls. When the turbo gauge is empty, no turbo attacks can be used until it filled up again. Two players standing next to each other can perform a tag team type of attack, which deal a lot more damage.

The player can gather items from the levels, or can purchase them in the shop with the gold they earned from the levels. Treasure is a rarity in Dark Legacy, as it is used to purchase items in the shop. Items are activated when picked up and can be disabled at any time using the item menu. Items provide many benefits, and once they're used up will disappear when done. 

The player has the ability to block, charg, and strafe. Blocking causes the player's character to stand still in a defensive position for a second, taking less damage from attacks. Strafing allows the player to constantly face one direction and fire medium-speed attacks. Charging makes the player run forward with his weapon functioning like a lance while simultaneously blocking. Charging consumes the turbo gauge every time you use it. 

Most levels involve simply running along a designated path, destroying enemies before they can kill you. Enemies spawn from generators and only when the generator is destroyed will the enemies stop spawning. Some generators will take multiple hits to destroy. Some levels are maze-like and are harder to traverse, while others are very linear in appearance with only side paths being more difficult due to a significant item being held there. Side paths usually lead to important items, such as treasure, legendary weapons, or runestones. Runestones are not hinted at though if a level that has a runestone is exited without the runestone being found, an evil laugh is be heard. Food recovers health with different types of food restoring different amounts of health.

### Final Thoughts
Overall, this game is fun to play. However, it lacks in linearity and overall gameplay. You're doing basically the same linear levels with no significant changes to the gaming experience overall. It's a slow dungeon crawler and games like these shouldn't be played alone This game is more fun played with friends, so grab some friends to play this one.
