## Summary

Donkey Kong Country 2: Diddy's Kong Quest is the immediate sequel to Donkey Kong Country on the SNES and revolves around both Diddy Kong and Dixie Kong. The game is set on Crocodile Isle as the player controls either Diddy Kong or Dixie Kong at one time through varying levels over eight different worlds. The main objective of the game is to rescue Donkey Kong from King K. Rool. The game features a wide number of enemies, which include land-based reptilian Kremlings, rats, porcupines, bees, and vultures. Enemies in underwater sections include pufferfish, stingrays and piranhas. Each world ends with a boss fight, which is required to be defeated in order to progress to the next world.

Similar to its predecessor, most hostiles can be defeated by either jumping on their heads, cartwheeling through them, or throwing a barrel at them. When hit by an enemy, the active character leaves the screen, thus control will switch to the other character. The player can reclaim their partner from marked DK barrels throughout the game. If both characters die, the player will lose a life and will restart from either the beginning of the level or from the last checkpoint, which comes in the form of a star-painted barrel. If the player loses all of their lives, the game will end. Diddy and Dixie have unique attributes; Diddy is more agile and will run faster, whereas Dixie has a higher jump and can spin her hair in order to float. The player can pick up the other character and throw them in any direction, similar to barrels. The game also features "animal friends", which returns from its predecessor. Playable animals include Squitter the spider, Rambi the rhino, Rattly the rattlesnake, Enguarde the swordfish and Squawks the parrot. These animals have unique abilities which the player can utilise, such as Rambi's ability to charge at enemies, Squawks' ability of flight, and Rattly's ability to jump extreme heights.

The game features environmental effects throughout some levels, which include fog, rain, and thunderstorms. Some levels feature different mechanics and settings, such as underwater sections, riding a mine cart, grappling onto vines, and "honey" levels which feature sticky surfaces. As with its predecessor, the game features barrels that will propel the player in any direction they are facing. Aside from checkpoint barrels, some give the player temporary invincibility or an "animal friend". Bonus barrels hidden throughout the game transport the player to a bonus game, which features a challenge such as eliminating all enemies in order to earn a "Kremcoin". In addition, there are some barrels that can only be activated by a specific character. Players may earn extra lives by collecting balloons, earning 100 bananas or collecting four letters which spell "KONG". The player can achieve a maximum completion score of 102% for their save file by completing all levels and bosses, completing all bonus challenges, collecting all DK coins within the Lost World and visiting each of the four Kong family members at least once. The game is Dixie Kong's first appearance in the Donkey Kong franchise. Other characters include Cranky Kong, situated in "Monkey Museum", who is back due to "popular demand" to divulge secrets of the game world, provide comic relief, as well as offering advice. Wrinkly Kong, the wife of Cranky Kong and grandmother of Donkey Kong, makes her first appearance in this game. She runs an educational facility called "Kong Kollege", where she gives guidance to the player. Swanky Kong runs a gameshow quiz where the player may complete quizzes and earn extra lives. Funky Kong offers an aeroplane that allows the players to switch between already completed worlds. Additionally, the player can meet a large Kremling called "Klubba", at "Klubba's Kiosk", who demands fifteen Kremkoins from the characters if they want to pass onto the "Lost World" and complete a secret level.

## Final Thoughts

This game can be very entertaining to play, whether your playing alone, playing co-op, or even going one-on-one. The music is memorable and the stages gradually get more interesting as you progress. However, the difficulty can ramp up rather quickly and new players can experience this pretty abruptly. For those familiar with the Donkey Kong Country series are used to the difficulty spikes, but for newcomers, it can be quite jolting. I'd pick this game up if you're looking for more of a challenging single-player experience, especially if you go for the fabled "102%" run. Otherwise, play this with friends and see how you can get because even though this game is difficult, it's not impossible. With enough determination (and lives), you should be able to beat this game in no time with how short it is.
