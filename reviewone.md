# Game Review for (Paper Mario)

## Details

### Game Title: Paper Mario



### Rating



## Summary

This game is about... this should be at least 3-4 paragraphs summarizing the
game play mechanics of the game. You should be answering the who, what,
when, where, why, and how of the game itself.

## Final Thoughts

At the time that this game came out, this is one of the most stylistic choice the Mario RPG franchise ever went with at the time, creating a world that looked like a pop up book.
