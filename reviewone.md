### Rating

My overall star rating for Paper Mario is a 4 out of 5 stars.

## Summary

Paper Mario is set in the Mushroom Kingdom as the protagonist Mario (you) tries to rescue Princess Peach from the antagonist, Bowser, who has imprisoned the seven "Star Spirits", lifted her castle into the sky. Bowser then defeats Mario after stealing the Star Rod from Star Haven by making himself invincible with its power. In order to restore the Mushroom Kingdom, save Princess Peach, and defeat Bowser, Mario must locate the Star Spirits. Their powers can negate the effects of the stolen Star Rod, but in order to do this, Mario must save each Star Spirit by defeating Bowser's minions who guard them. The player must solve puzzles in the game's overworld and defeat enemies in a turn-based battle system. The battles are unique in that the player can influence the power or effectiveness of attacks by performing required controller inputs known as "action commands".

For the majority of the game, the player controls Mario, who can jump and use his hammer to overcome physical obstacles placed in the game's overworld. Many of the game's puzzles and boundaries are based upon the abilities of Mario's partners, who each have a specialized skill required for progression in the game. The player gains more partners as they advance into different locations; only one partner can accompany Mario in the overworld, although the player can interchange them at any time. These characters also assist Mario in the game's turn-based battles as well, where damage inflicted against them results in temporary paralysis as the characters do not have individual HP statistics. Attacks in the game are similar to those in traditional RPGs, although the player can influence the power of a move when attacking or defending by timing a button-press accurately or performing some other action command as required. Mario and his partners have a finite capacity to perform special moves, with each of these consuming a particular number of flower points (FP) when performed. Such statistics can be increased by earning Star Points (experience points) in combat to level up.

There is also an on-screen gauge to display Star Energy, which is required to perform another type of move that accumulates in number as the player advances through the game (Note/Spoiler: The Star Gauge is not active immediately. You can only obtain the Star Gauge after saving a Star Spirit). The player can locate hidden battle upgrades in the game's overworld, which promotes one partner character to a new rank at a time. Progression through Paper Mario depends upon interaction with the game's non-player characters (NPCs), who would often offer clues or detail the next event in the storyline. As in other RPGs, the player can find or purchase items from NPCs to help in and outside of combat. Badges can also be obtained that yield bonuses ranging from added moves to gradual health restoration during combat; each consumes a set number of Badge Points (BP), meaning Mario can only equip a limited number of badges at a time. Princess Peach is playable at particular points in the game as a recurring sidequest. The objectives and actions of each transition to Peach vary, although most are stealth-based.

## Final Thoughts

At the time that this game came out, the style of choice Paper Mario went for was one of the most creative in the entire franchise, creating and transforming a world that looks like paper and opens up like a pop up book when you walk into certain buildings. Even though so much time has passed since this game's debut, it still holds up as one of the best Mario games in my opinion. However, keep in mind, this game can feel like you're reading a book and the dialogue can ramp up as you go further into the story. Also, some story elements can be a little tedious, especially if the player forgot an important key item in the game, forcing a backtrack in order to progress. Despite this, the game is charming, its aesthetically pleasing, and is an amazing staple in Nintendo's library. I highly recommend this game to those who enjoy single-player RPG games. If you're into more action-based strategy or you're not into the story element, I'd give this one a pass, but still recommend it if you're looking for a slower paced game.
