# Game Review for (Tetris & Dr. Mario)

## Details

### Game Title: Tetris & Dr. Mario

Tetris & Dr. Mario is a puzzle video game compilation made in 1994 and was developed by Intelligent Systems and published by Nintendo for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES). It contains enhanced remakes of Tetris (1989) and Dr. Mario (1990), which were originally released for both the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) and Game Boy.

### Rating

My overall star rating for Tetris & Dr. Mario is a 3.25 out of 5.

## Summary

Tetris & Dr. Mario shares a similar design to the respective NES versions of the games included while featuring music from their Game Boy versions. In Tetris, players must use different types of falling tetrominoes to form complete lines from the left to the right of the playfield, without any holes between them. Completed lines will disappear and cause any blocks on top to fall towards the bottom. Players can rotate the blocks to place them in specific spots, and can also hold down to make them fall faster. Once all the blocks reach the top of the screen, the game will be over. Tetris includes the "A-Type" and "B-Type" modes from the Game Boy version, alongside a head-to-head multiplayer mode. Also, if a player's stack of pieces reaches the top of the screen, it’s game over in single player or the player loses the round in multiplayer. There's also a Vs. mode against a CPU player with various difficulties: Easy, Normal, and Hard.

In Dr. Mario, players must use colored pills to defeat the viruses littered around the playfield. Viruses come in red, yellow and blue, and must be eliminated by matching two or more same-colored pills either horizontally or vertically. These pills can be one solid color or a mixture of two, one on each side. Pills can be rotated around, and can be dropped faster by pressing down. Once all the viruses have been cleared, the player will move onto the next stage. The game will be over if the pills reach the top of the screen. Dr. Mario features a two-player mode where both players must compete against each other to clear the stage of viruses. The first to clear the viruses off their stage first wins. Also, if a player's pill overlaps with another pill, it’s game over in single player or the player loses the round in multiplayer.

Alongside both games, a "Mixed Match" multiplayer mode is also included, where players must compete for the most points before time runs out. When a player fulfill the win condition for the round, the player wins a point. The mode transitions between both games as players progress, beginning at Tetris' B-Type mode before moving to Dr. Mario and so forth. The player with the most points at the end is deemed the winner. Before the game begins, players can customize the game's music, time limit, and difficulty level. There isn't a single-player mode for Mixed Match. If anyone reaches the top of their stack, the game doesn't end. Instead, it resets the preset determined before the game began for the player who reached the top.

## Final Thoughts

These two games are infamous for their addictive nature and for getting hours upon hours of playtime. Tetris moreso but otherwise both games have stood the tests of time and Tetris and Dr. Mario have new games implemented as early as this year (2020) that are regularly played on a daily or weekly basis. The downside of these games is that they're very one dimensional. You won't be doing anything else other than trying to achieve the high score in Tetris or beat every level in Dr. Mario. There are multiplayer options for both games and the additional 2-player only Mixed Match game mode, but that's it as far as your options go. If you're a big fan of both games and enjoy playing competitively with friends and family, this game is for you. If you don't like puzzle games or you're looking for more of a collection set rather than just the two games, I'd give it a pass.
