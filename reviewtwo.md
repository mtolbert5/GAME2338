I give the overall star rating for The Legend of Zelda: Four Swords Adventures a 3 out of 5

## Summary

The game takes place a century after Twilight Princess, within the event of the "Child Timeline", and is the final game in this timeline, chronologically. The game features a separate incarnation of the Dark Lord Ganondorf/The Dark Beast Ganon to the one whose backstory is shown in Ocarina of Time, something which is unique to Four Swords Adventure. The game takes Link (you) on an adventure to restore peace to Hyrule after learning that an evil counterpart of himself, Shadow Link, has been created. The main mode of Four Swords Adventures is "Hyrulean Adventure", an episodic cooperative multiplayer adaptation of the conventional The Legend of Zelda gameplay. "Shadow Battle" is a competitive multiplayer battle mode. Hyrulean Adventure is the main campaign of Four Swords Adventures, and can be played by one to four players. It consists of eight worlds, each with three stages and a boss battle. The graphics are similar to that of the Game Boy Advance version, but the maps are static rather than randomly generated, the top-down view is taken from its predecessor The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, and gameplay includes effects from The Wind Waker. The graphics include enhanced atmospheric effects such as cloud shadows that slowly move across the ground, heat shimmer, dust storms, and fog. Music is based on that of A Link to the Past, but is rearranged in places.

In Hyrulean Adventure, most of the same mechanics as the previously released Four Swords for the Game Boy Advance (GBA) are used. The multiplayer version requires each player to have a GBA, which is used as a controller and to which the action transfers when that player's character goes off the main screen, but the single-player game may be played with either a GameCube controller or a GBA. There are always four Link characters (differentiated by different colors: green, red, blue and purple) in play, regardless of the number of people playing; "extra" Links are attached to those directly controlled and positioned around the controlling character. Normally, the extra Links follow the player, but players can separate an individual Link and control independently, or put the four Links into formations. These techniques are required to solve puzzles and defeat enemies. Players are encouraged to work together to gather enough Force Gems to empower the Four Sword, and failing to do so by the time the boss is defeated or the dark barrier is reached results in having to go back to the beginning of the stage to collect more. However, once the requisite gems are collected, players are automatically transported to the dark barrier and therefore do not have to repeat the entire stage. Players can play minigames in multiplayer mode at Tingle's Tower, which appears in every world, to gain extra multiplayer lives. These eight games are earned by playing though certain stages in multiplayer mode. The minigames include horse racing, hammer tag, monster hunting and five others. Tingle Tower is not available in single-player mode.

In Shadow Battle, two or more players battle each other until only one is left standing. As in Hyrulean Adventure, each player uses a different-colored Link character and wields various tools to attack the other Links. Initially, there are five stages which players can choose as the battle's arena. Five bonus maps are unlocked upon completion of Hyrulean Adventure (these "dark stages" are almost the same as the first five maps, but portals to the dark world appear and the player has limited vision). In each stage, items randomly appear, and are usually similar to the items in Hyrulean Adventure. There are many special objects in each stage, which can be used to the player's advantage. There is a time limit; when it reaches zero, the game is tied. This is a multiplayer exclusive game mode.

## Final Thoughts

This game isn't as entertaining as its predecessors as far as content is concerned. This game mostly shines in its multiplayer content, including entire game modes focused around it. The multiplayer aspect as well as the story and music, visual and sound effects is where this game truly outdoes itself. However, it's single-player content is fairly lacking. You can play this game solo, but you won't get the most out of it due to how focused the gameplay is circled around the multiplayer. Also, if you don't have the game boy advance with the link cable, you won't be able to access certain game modes or play this game with the most convenience. Definitely play this with friends if you have the all the things you need. If there's any other reason to link your Gameboy Advance to your GameCube, this is definitely one of them for the multiplayer and even for the single-player experience. Otherwise, if you want a more single-player focused Legend of Zelda game, this isn't the game for you.
